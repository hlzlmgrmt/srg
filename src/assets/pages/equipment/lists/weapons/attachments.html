<h5>Advanced Safety Systems</h5>
<p></p>
<p>This attachment can be applied to all ranged weapons (including grenades) and melee weapons that require a Matrix
  connection.</p>
<p><b>Base Modifier: </b>The weapon cannot be turned on or fired unless the persona of the weapons' current holder
  is authorized by the owner of the weapon.</p>
<p><b>Modification Options: </b>1x Self-Destruction (if an unauthorized user tries to fire the weapon, it detonates,

<h5>Attachable Stock</h5>
<p></p>
<p>This attachment can be applied to all guns and crossbows without the Cumbersome qualiy, except Holdout Pistols and
  Tasers.</p>
<p><b>Base Modifier: </b>As a maneuver, the stock can be attached or detached from the weapon. When attached to a
  one-handed ranged weapon, the weapon can be fired with the Ranged (Heavy) skill, and increases their Encumbrance
  rating by 2. When detached from a two-handed ranged weapon, the weapon gains the Inaccurate 2 quality, but decreases
  its Encumbrance rating by 2. The stock itself has an Encumbrance rating of 2 while detached. Two-handed ranged weapons
  replace their pre-built stock with this, and do not increase their Encumbrance rating due to this attachment
</p>
<p><b>Modification Options: </b>1x Folding Stock (Attach or Detach stock as an Incidental) Mod, 1x Lightweight (Enc. -1)
  Mod, 1x Quality (HP +1) Mod, 1x Quality (Accurate +1) Mod</p>

<h5>Suppressor</h5>
<p>As the classic assassin’s accessory, suppressors allow a user to keep unwanted attention from themselves by
  supressing noise. Unlike the silencers often found in mainstream action trideos, suppressors do not make a gun
  magically imperceptible; If a suppressed weapon is fired inside a small enclosed room, people will notice the gunfire.
  Rather, a suppressor will distort the sound of gunfire to a point that people will not perceive it as such, especially
  when the sound comes from behind a bunch of walls. This additionally hinders witnesses of an assassination in locating
  the shooter in time.</p>
<p>Due to this, after-market attachments of suppressors are generally illegal, but more often than not, corporate
  security – especially those within arcologies – carry suppressed weapons to deal with criminals without enticing mass
  panic within the closed environment. Guns sold with integrated suppressors are therefore known and registered, and –
  with the right licenses of course – legal to buy and carry.</p>
<p>Suppressors come in two variants: Attached and integrated. Attached suppressors do not cost Hard Points, but are
  rather big and clunky, and therefor add one point of Encumbrance to the weapon while attached. Attaching a suppressor
  uses a maneuver, and getting caught with one is generally a bad idea. Integrated suppressors are built into the gun
  barrel itself. They cost a single Hard Point, but do not add to the weapons bulk. Spotting an inbuilt suppressor
  requires a Hard (<span class="glyph difficulty">kkk</span>) Perception or Mechanics check.</p>
<p>This attachment can be applied to pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, precision rifles and sniper rifles.</p>
<p><b>Base Modifiers: </b>Adds <span class="glyph setback">jj</span> to all Perception or Vigilance checks made to
  locate a concealed shooter. Inbuild suppressors require a Hard (<span class="glyph difficulty">kkk</span>) Perception
  or Mechanics check to be spotted.</p>
<p><b>Modification Options: </b>2x Improvement (Add additional <span class="glyph setback">j</span> to Perception and
  Vigilance checks to spot shooter) Mod</p>
