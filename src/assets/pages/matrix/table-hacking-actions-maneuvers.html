      <td><b>Issue Command: </b>You issue command to a drone, vehicle or program that you control. At the Gamemasters

    <tr>
      <td><b>Data Spike: </b>Your character attacks a persona, icon or device with malicious code. On a successful
        Hacking combat check, the target suffers an amount of System Strain equal to your character's Intellect rating,
        plus any uncancelled <span class="glyph">s</span>. If the target does not nave a System Strain monitor, it
        instead gets damaged by one step, plus an additional step for every uncancelled <span class="glyph">ss</span>,
        which can potentially break a device in one go.

    <tr>
      <td><b>Take Over: </b>Your character hijacks a device. On a success, until the end the turn, you can use
        the device as if you were its' owner, plus an additional turn for each uncanceled <span class="glyph">s</span>.
        As part of the hack, you can issue a simple command; your target acts immediately after your turn.

    <tr>
      <td><b>Jam Device: </b>You cut off all direct communication from a device or persona. On a success, until the end
        of the turn, the target cannot send or receive any messages through the Matrix, plus an additional turn for each
        <span class="glyph">s</span> generated on the hack.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Trace: </b>You attempt to find hidden icons and personal. Make a Computers check. On a success, you find
        and trace a single icon or persona you were looking for, or the most dangerous or interesting icon or persona in
        the designated area.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Hide: </b>Your character tries to hide icons or their persona from Matrix perception. Make an opposed
        Hacking vs. Computers skill check. On a success, your adversary loses track of your persona or your icons, and
        must spend an opposed Trace action against your Hacking skill to find you again. When you use any Hacking action
        while hiding, an actively searching adversary immediately spots you.
