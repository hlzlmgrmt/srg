<p>Once you've spent your character's starting Karma, the next step is to determine your character's derived
  attributes:</p>
<p><b>Wound Threshold: </b>Your character's wound threshold represents how much physical damage they are able to
  withstand before becoming incapacitated. Your character's starting wound threshold is determined by adding their
  metatypes base wound threshold to their Brawn rating. After you determine this initial value, further increases of
  your Brawn do not increase your wound threshold.<br/></p>
<p><b>Strain Threshold: </b>Your character's strain threshold how much mental stress your character can withstand before
  becoming stunned, dazed or otherwise incapacitated. Your character's strain threshold is determined by adding their
  metatypes base strain threshold to their Willpower rating. After you determine this initial value, further increases
  of your Willpower do not increase your strain threshold.</p>
<p><b>Soak: </b>Your character's soak value determines how much damage they can shrug off every time they're hit. When
  your character suffers damage - usually by getting hit by an attack - you subtract your character's soak value from
  the damage inflicted, before applying the remaining damage against your wound or strain threshold.</p>
<p>Your character's base soak value is equal to their Brawn rating. After you determine this initial value, further
  increases to your character's Brawn rating <i>do</i> increase their soak value. Further increases in your character's
  soak limit are often applied by gear, most commonly by bodytech and armor, and talents. Usually, multiple sources of
  armor are not cumulative, unless specifically specified.</p>
<p><b>Defense: </b>Your character's defense represents their extra levels in protection that makes them harder to hit in
  combat. Defense is divided into <i>melee defense</i> and <i>ranged defense</i>. Your character's starting defense is
  0, and typically raised through equipment and talents.</p>
<p>Each point of defense adds <span class="glyph setback">j</span> to all attacks coming towards your character; melee
  defense thereby protects your character against swords and punches, while ranged defense protects your character from
  gunfire, thrown knifes and most ranged spells. Unless otherwise specified, defense from different sources do not stack
  - for example, a Barrier spell granting your character one point of defense does not add to the point of defense
  already gained through a worn Armor Jacket - but effects that explicitly add to your defenses - such as the Defensive
  and Deflective item qualities - do stack with your inherit defense. Additionally, the maximum amount of defense a
  character can have is 4.</p>
<p><b>System Strain: </b>Your character's system strain represents how much damage your persona - your digital
  manifestation in the Matrix - can receive before shattering. A shattered persona renders you offline and unable to
  interact with the Matrix in any way, until your persona is repaired. Usually, your system strain threshold is 8, and
  can be increases with enhancements to your commlink, cyberdeck or RCC.</p>
<p>However, if your character is <i>Emergent</i> - for example by having Resonance as an archetype skill at character
  creation - you do not have a system strain threshold; instead, your strain threshold becomes your system strain
  threshold.</p>
<p><b>Firewall: </b>Firewall determines how well your persona is protected from hacking and tempering. Your character's
  firewall behaves as equal part Soak and Defense against hacking attempts against you. Firewall is most commonly gaines
  through gear and talents, and usually starts at 0.</p>
