<p>Once you've spent your character's starting Karma, the next step is to determine your character's derived
  attributes:</p>
<p><b>Wound Threshold: </b>Your character's wound threshold represents how much physical damage they are able to
  withstand before becoming incapacitated. Your character's starting wound threshold is determined by adding their
  metatypes base wound threshold to their Brawn rating. After you determine this initial value, further increases of
  your Brawn do not increase your wound threshold.<br/></p>
<p><b>Strain Threshold: </b>Your character's strain threshold how much mental stress your character can withstand before
  becoming stunned, dazed or otherwise incapacitated. Your character's strain theshold is determined by adding their
  metatypes base strain threshold to their Willpower rating. After you determine this initial value, further increases
  of your Willpower do not increase your strain threshold.</p>
<p><b>Defense: </b></p>
<p><b>Soak: </b></p>
<p><b>System Strain: </b>Your character's system strain represents how much damage your persona - your digital
  manifestation in the Matrix - can receive before shattering. A shattered persona renders you offline and unable to
  interact with the Matrix in any way, until your persona is repaired. Usually, your system strain threshold is 8, and
  can be increases with enhancements to your commlink, cyberdeck or RCC.</p>
<p>However, if your character is <i>Emergent</i> - for example by having Resonance as an archetype skill at character
  creation - you do not have a system strain threshold; instead, your strain threshold becomes your system strain
  threshold.</p>
<p><b>Firewall: </b>Firewall determines how well your persona is protected from hacking and tempering. Your character's
  firewall behaves as equal part Soak and Defense against hacking attempts against you. Firewall is most commonly gaines
  through gear and talents, and usually starts at 0.</p>
