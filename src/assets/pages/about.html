<p>The <i>Shadowrun Genesys</i> project is a one-to six man project that aims to reduce the crunch of the Shadowrun
  TTRPGs and minimize them into a simpler, yet similarly exciting format. Ports of Shadowrun for the <i>Genesys</i> and
  <i>GURPS</i> systems already exist, but they often keep the bloated complexity of the original system, resulting in
  hundreds of pages of tables and sub-rules of sub-rules that make switching to those ports difficult; the motivation of
  this port mainly stems from a quote from one of the players of our group:
  <i>"I don't care for the subsystems of this single gun, i just want to grab a rifle and go ham."</i></p>
<p>This web application is mainly meant as a collection of rules and tables specific to the Shadowrun setting and mostly
  meant for groups already familiar with the <i>Genesys</i> or <i>FFG Star Wars</i> systems, and therefore do not go
  into detail about the specifics of <i>how to play GeneSys</i>. However, this webapp is meant to be read as auxiliary
  material to a character sheet, and therefore tries to explain the mechanics implemented on said sheet as short as
  possible. Additionally, mechanics already present in Genesys, such as the Talent Pyramid or Basic Skills like
  Athletics or Ranged (Light) are outlined in their own subsection to reduce the need to consult the <i>Genesys</i> core
  rulebook for description texts and tables that could easily be implemented into the webapp itself.</p>
