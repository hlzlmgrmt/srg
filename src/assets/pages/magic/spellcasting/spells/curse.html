<p>Curses inflict negative afflictions and effects to targets without causing direct harm, wether through direct
  penalties to checks made by the cursed target, sicknesses that ravage their bodies or the illusion of excruciating
  pain. In combat, most curses are simple debuffs that hinder adversaries in their ability to do things. Outside of
  combat, curses can be longer lasting and more deliberate; someone could be forced to vomit, for example.</p>
<p><b>Sustained: </b>Yes</p>
<p><b>Base Spell: </b>You weaken a target within short range with a hex. If successful, as long as the spell is
  sustained, the target decreases the ability of all skill checks they make by one (in effect, this means they remove
  one <span class="glyph ability">k</span> from their checks). Once per turn, as a maneuver, or once per minute, the
  target of a curse can attempt to break the spell by succeeding a Resilience skill check as a Contested check against
  your Spellcasting skill.</p>
<p><b>Base Difficulty: </b>Average(<span class="glyph difficulty">kk</span>)</p>
