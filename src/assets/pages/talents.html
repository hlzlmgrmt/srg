<p>Talents represent specialized techniques that a character has mastered, typically through intense practice
  and study. A character is likely to be more efficient wen engaged in actions for which they have appropriate skills
  and talents.</p>
<p>Generally, skills are what your character uses to perform a task. If your character wishes to perform a task in a
  specific way, they need to use learned talents. Talents also can be used to modify your characters attributes, or
  allow them to perform actions normally not allowed by the rules.</p>

<h2>Talent Tiers & The Talent Pyramid</h2>
<p>Some talents are better than others; they may have more exiting abilities, or just better mechanical boosts. To
  differentiate between "less" and "more" powerful abilities and techniques, each talent has a rank, called a "Tier". A
  talent tier is between 1 and 5, with 1 being small, but not insubstantial, bonuses to a character, and 5 being very
  powerful abilities that can grant a character permanent, mayor boons. Talents are purchased by spending an amount of
  Karma equal to its rank times 5 (that means, for example, a Tier 3 talent costs 15 Karma).</p>
<p>When you buy a new talent for your character, you must have more talents in the next lowest tier than the current
  talent tier; this is called "building a <i>Talent Pyramid</i>. That means, for example, if your character wants to buy
  their first Tier 2 talent, they must have at least two Tier 1 talent. Additionally, they cannot buy any Tier 3 talents
  until they have purchased a second Tier 2 talent, which in turn requires a third Tier 1 talent.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Ranked Talents</h2>
<p>Most talents can only be purchased once. However, some talents are ranked, which means that they can be purchased
  multiple times, making their main effect stronger. This can make some abilities very powerful at higher ranks.</p>
<p>Every time you want buy a new rank in a talent you have already purchased, you purchase it as a new talent and
  increase its tier by one; For example, if you want to buy a second rank of a Tier 1 talent, you treat it as a new Tier
  2 talent. This also means, since you are adding a new talent to the Talent Pyramid, that you have to ensure that you
  have purchased a second Tier 1 talent beforehand. Additionally, if a ranked talent is already at Tier 5, you cannot
  purchase more ranks in this talent.</p>
<p>Some talents, like the <i>Dedication</i> talent, are not ranked, but are able to be purchased multiple times; often,
  these talents provide specific benefits for individual attributes of your character, and purchasing it multiple times
  allows your character to gain these benefits for multiple situations.</p>

<h3>Talent Entries</h3>
<p>The following is a list of talents that your character can buy. The talents are grouped by tier, and in each
  grouping, the talents are listed alphabetically. Each grouping has a description of what talents of this tier are
  <i>generally</i> able to do, and if you <b>and</b> your Gamemaster wish to invent a specific talent not listed in
  the list of talents, you can orientate yourself on the general description of these.</p>
<p>Each talent entry conveys specific information:</p>
<p><b>Name: </b>Each talent has a unique name, making it easy for you to refer to the talent, and adding a bit of
  fluff.</p>
<p><b>Tier: </b>Each talent belongs to a tier, as previously described.</p>
<p><b>Activation: </b>Each talent can either have a passive, or an active effect. Passive talents constantly apply to
  your character after purchase; Toughened, for example, permanently increases your wound threshold after you have
  purchased it. Active talents must be actively used by your character in order to benefit from them. Active talents
  always include their activation time - that means, the amount of time it uses in order for your character to benefit
  from this effect - either in parenthesis, or in the talent description. Additionally, unless marked as "Out-of-Turn",
  active talents can only be used on your turn.</p>
<p><b>Ranked: </b>Some talents are ranked, with means that they have a cumulative effect when bought multiple times.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites: </b>Sometimes, talents require certain conditions before they can be bought; maybe they require
  your character to be able to use magic, or sometimes they improve your already existing talents.</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>Each talent provides a rule of their effect. When designing your own talents, you should avoid
  overly complicated talent descriptions and rules; instead, split your talent into multiple talents that each require a
  chain of talents.</p>
