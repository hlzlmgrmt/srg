<p>Qi-Magic, often called “Physical Magic”, or Qi is the supernatural skill of Adepts to embolden their own bodies and
  minds with magic, granting them supernatural abilities and feats on par or superior to that of most bodytech. At it’s
  most basic, QI enables oneself to temporarily enhance a non-magical skill, but with training a skilled Adept learns to
  utilize their powers to run up walls, deflect bullets with a sword, supernaturally perceive dangers and traps before
  they happen and even closing their own mortal wounds with the sheer power of their will. If an adept combines the
  physical prowess to Qi with the more arcane arts of spellcasting, they are often referred as Mystic Adepts; people
  that have awakened these powers are extremely rare in the Sixth World, and unnaturally powerful and versatile in the
  employment of their skills.</p>
<p>A character with at least a single rank in Qi-Magic is allowed to purchase special talents: Adept Powers. A full list
  of Adept Powers can be found <a href="magic/qi/adept_powers_list.html">here</a>. A character may only purchase an
  Adept Power if
  their ranks in Qi is at least equal to the rank of the power purchased. Usually, Qi functions as a support skill for
  other skills, and usually doesn’t allow yourself to substitute itself for another skill; For example, even if using an
  Adept Power that allows you to run on walls, you still need to pass an Athletics check – enhanced by the power - in
  order to determine the outcome of your desired action.</p>
