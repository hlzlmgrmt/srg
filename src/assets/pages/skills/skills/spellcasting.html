<p>The Spellcasting skill represents your ability to manipulate magical energies and form them into a wide variety of
  spells. This includes fireballs, magical levitation, mind reading and otherwise supernatural powers. Characters
  proficient in the art of spellcasting are often referred to as magicians, even though not all follow the tradition of
  the Hermetic Mage.</p>
<p>Each time a character take a rank in Spellcasting, they gain access to a spell, and add it to their spell repertoire.
  A full list of spells can be found <a href="magic/spellcasting/spells.html">here</a>.</p>
