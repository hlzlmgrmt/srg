<p>Tier 2 talents often encompass talents that change how a character is going to behave throuought an encounter or a scene. 
  In combat, talents that reliably apply defenses and that give character more combat options fit this tier, as well as 
  talents that provide minor, but useful bonuses to their allies. Overall, Tier 2 talents are useful enough for most characters 
  to take, without them becoming an "auto-include" on every character.</p>
