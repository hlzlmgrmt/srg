<p>The Matrix is the term of the worldwise computer network of the Sixth World. It was created after the First Matrix
  Crash of 2029 and rebuilt as the Wireless Matrix after the Crash 2.0 of 2064. The Matrix consists of countless data
  streams and icons and is accessed either indirectly via Augmented Reality, overlaying and enhancing elements of the
  real world, or through Virtual Reality, where a user can project their minds directly into a physical manifestation of
  the global net.</p>
<p>Most people use the Matrix extensively in their daily lives; shopping, communicating, even attending parties in
  Virtual Reality. Most people interface with the net through their commlinks; small, handheld devices that communicate
  the will of their users with the underlying foundation. Special glasses, gloves and earbuds are cheap and let people
  interact with digital objects in real space, but are steadily replaced by trode networks and almost non-invasive
  DNIs; these devices directly read the brainwaves of their users, and can directly interface the users brain to
  the Matrix. Most people do not even touch their devices these days, only interacting with the Matrix through pop-up
  displays, voice interfaces, and thoughts.</p>
<p>Since everyone does everything on the net nowadays, deckers are widely feared for their ability to manipulate the
  data streams of the net to their advantage. Despite the name, deckers do not necessarily need to employ cyberdecks; a
  run-off-the-mill commlink often does the job well enough, and is not nearly as expensive as a professional deck.</p>
<p>When interacting with the Matrix, a hacker must keep two concepts in mind: <b>Personas</b> and <b>Interaction
  Modes</b></p>.

<h2>Personas</h2>
<p>A persona is the embodiment of a person, inside of the Matrix. Even when a person does not have any devices on
  themselves, they still weirdly enough have a persona (probably due to nanites in the air or something). The persona
  provides the main access of a person to the Matrix, while their commlink (or any similar device) provides an interface
  to direct that persona. Each persona has a <b>System Strain</b> threshold. If that threshold is reached or exceeded,
  the persona is destroyed, and the personas’ owner loses access to the Matrix, being considered <i>offline</i>. While
  offline,
  they unable to interact with anything on the net, and even having difficulty using their own gear, weapons and even
  bodytech. A destroyed persona has to be repaired, and simply switching out a commlink doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Usually, the location of a persona overlaps with the physical location of a person in Realspace. Therefore, when
  attempting to interact with another persona in Realspace, two people need to see each other. Deckers trying to hack
  another persona or any device in Realspace therefore must have a Line of Sight to their target, which is limited to
  Long range.</p>

<h2>AR and VR</h2>
<p>Since everyone nowadays is equipped with technology that allows them to interact with the Matrix without touching any
  physical device, everyone is able to enter Virtual Reality at any time they want. When someone enters VR, they leave
  their unconscious bodies behind and become one with their personas, allowing someone in VR to move their virtual
  bodies around independently from their physical bodies, as long as they are aware of their digital surroundings.
  Switching interaction modes always takes a maneuver.</p>

<h2>Hacking Basics</h2>
<p>A decker uses the Hacking skill to hack a device. Hacking counts as a combat skill, and encompasses all actions that
  utilize methods of breaking and subverting established Matrix security protocols. It differentiates itself from the
  Computers skill, which mostly encapsulates more legal and generalized ways of using the Matrix, like information
  gathering or writing programs.</p>
<p>Deckers usually employ cyberdecks, but can use commlinks to archive similar results, albeit with small setbacks;
  Hacking skill checks using a commlink add <span class="glyph setback">j</span> to their dice pool.</p>
<p>When hacking a target, two things are important: The relative distance between a hackers persona and a target, which
  determines the base difficulty of the Hacking skill check equal to normal combat checks, and the targets Firewall
  rating, which serves as Soak and Defense against hacking attempts.</p>
