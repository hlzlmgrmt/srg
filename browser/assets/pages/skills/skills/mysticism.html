<p>Mysticism is the esoteric discipline of spiriualists and aura readers to interact with the Astral Space. As a skill,
  it combines the powers of Assensing and Astral Projection, and allows a practitioner of these arts to read and
  interpret the auras of living and magical things alike, and to leave their own bodies behind in order to project their
  own astral bodies into Astral Space. Advanced practitioners of this discipline are known to effortlessly see through
  lies and illusions alike, pinpoint and identify magical threats, fight with hidden spirits and watchers in their own
  terf, and even manipulate ley-lines in order to strengthen their own spells. The skill even allows a practitioner to
  increase the potential of magical artifacts, such as Foci, beyond their usual limits.</p>
