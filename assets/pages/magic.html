<p>Magic works!</p>

<h2>The Laws of Magic</h2>
<p>R&D of multiple corporations and research in the field of Unified Magical Theory have found five limits to magic,
  that are, al least at the moment, impossible to breach:</p>
<p><b>Magic cannot influence the stream of time.</b><br/>
  While some magicians can see glimpses of future or past events, they are powerless to influence them with
  time-manipulating magic. Additionally, as an apparent law of the universe, glimpses into the flow of time become less
  coherent and detailed the further they are away from the present, making them a way less useful prediction tool than
  most A.Is.</p>
<p><b>Magic cannot directly alter the fabric of space.</b><br/>
  True teleportation, the folding of space and similar means of faster-than-light transportation is not possible with
  magic, and abilities that appear like instantaneous teleportation are generally just feats of superhuman speeds.
  Even though an astrally projecting magician or a spirit can appear anywhere they want, they cannot interact with
  anything in physical space, unless they anchor themselves to a vessel, and even then they are still anchored to their
  original plane of existence, and their physical bodies inside of that plane.</p>
<p><b>Magic cannot permanently create matter.</b><br/>
  Magic can only form matter from one form to another, and conjure forth spirits in the form of sentient tools, arms
  and armor, but it cannot make these things out of nothing; if this would be possible, corporations would long have
  given up on ways to secure scarce resources.</p>
<p><b>Magic cannot return the dead to life.</b><br/>
  There are magicians who claim that they can raise the dead. These magicians, most reknown of which are the Houngan
  and Mambo of the voodoo tradition, are guiding a spirit into the corpse of a recently deceased corpse, animating
  them in the process and giving them the appearance of returned life. While the voodoo-priests do not deny that they
  appease the <i>loa</i> in this way, some charlatans earn a fortune by conjuring forth illusions of their deceased
  loved ones. The sad truth is that, unless the deceased corpse is exceptionally fresh and in peak condition - about
  just outside of what a doctor with a defibrillator could do - magic cannot return those that have passed on. People
  have been saved while already standing on the rainbow bridge, and magic capable of doing that is exceptionally rare
  (and expensive), but when a person dies, their spirit vanishes; only echoes of these people exist, which necromancers
  sometimes use to create almost perfect copies of the deceased.</p>
<p><b>Magic cannot interact with the Matrix.</b><br/>
  TBD</p>

<p>When designing magical elements of a story, a Gamemaster should keep in mind that breaking these limits is a mayor
  feat of magical prowess that would change the foundations of society by a large margin. Additionally, players should
  <i>never</i> be given the opportunity to break these laws, simply because the funding, research and resources needed
  to even attempt this far exceeds the capacity of even the most legendary Shadowrunner.</p>
