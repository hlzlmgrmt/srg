<p>Burdens represent the debts a Player Character owes. Defined simply, they are among the main reasons a Player
  Character is a Shadowrunner in the first place. These debts may include money owed, binding contracts,
  responsibilities, addictions or similar that the character holds in high regard. A character's actions can often be
  guided by his Burdens and can have very tangible effects in their development.</p>
<p>Over the course of a campaign, unresolved burdens can put pressure on characters. Additional burdens may be given out
  by the Gamemaster, awarding them goods and services that would normally be out of reach for them. This provides
  players with a choice; do they resolve their burdens as quickly as possible, do they maintain their current burdens,
  or do they take on even more in the hopes that the risks will pay off in the future? Additionally, Gamemasters can
  hand out burdens as consequences for bad choices, or just plain bad luck; maybe a Player Character gets blackmailed by
  a rival runner for a job gone bad, or they suffer an addition due to prolonged substance abuse.</p>

<h3>Starting Burdens</h3>
<p>Each Player Character starts with at least one Burden. Each player should work together with their Gamemaster in
  incorporating these Burdens into the character's backstory and the setting itself. Burdens be as elaborate part or the
  character's main Motivations - such as a detailed relocation of how the character was an involuntary test subject who
  escaped a secret corporate laboratory and is actively hunted by said corporation - or quite vague - such as simply
  having kids - as long as these Burdens can be used to add personal stakes to a Player Characters life in the
  shadows.</p>
<p>Each Burden consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>A title: </b>This does not have any direct rules effects, but is intended to offer an explanation that allows
    the player to work the Obligation into their character's story.
  </li>
  <li><b>A size </b> This is the Burden's size, and determines the mechanical effects of a Burden. The size of each
    players starting Burdens is based on the starting number if players, as determined in the table below:
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <caption>Starting Burdens</caption>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th># of PCs in the Team</th>
      <th>Recommended Default Starting burdens per player</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4-5</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6+</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In addition, players may choose to increase the size or their characters' starting Burden when they choose them, in
  order to either gain additional starting karma, or additional money to purchase starting gear. However, doing so
  puts greater responsibilities on the individual character (and therefore the runner team as a whole).</p>
<p>Players can purchase additional burdens according to the table below. There are two limitations to this however; each
  player can only choose each option once, and Player Characters cannot gain more additional Burdens than their original
  starting value.</p>
