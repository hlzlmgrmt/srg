<p>Before spending any Karma during character creation, a character may choose five of their archetype skills and gain
  one rank in each of them. The rank of there skills cannot be raised above 2 at character creation. Archetype skills
  can be noted with a small
  <b style="font-size: x-large; margin: 0 0.25rem; color: darkgrey; -webkit-text-stroke: 0.4px black;">•</b> next to the
  skill.</p>

<h3>Rules for Creating Custom Archetypes</h3>
<p>When creating an archetype, each character gains ten archetype skills. These skills are associated with your
  characters general career, and taking ranks in these are generally cheaper than taking ranks in non-archetype
  skills.</p>
<p>When creating a custom Archetype for your character, choose 6 general skills that define the general archetype of the
  character. Then, choose 4 more skills, and you...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>...must have at least 1 social or combat skill,</li>
  <li>...must have at least 1 knowledge skill,</li>
  <li>...can’t have more than 3 combat skills (Hacking, Spellcasting, Summoning and Resonance all count as a combat
    skill),
  </li>
  <li>...can’t have more than 3 social skills,</li>
  <li>...can’t have more than 4 knowledge skills,</li>
  <li>...can’t have more than 2 additional general skills</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These skills broadly represent a specialization of your character within its base archetype.
</p>
<p>Magical skills have some further restrictions: When taking a magical skill as an archetype skill, you must pay 15
  Karma for each skill, and you cannot take Resonance as a magical archetype skill if you have taken any other magical
  archetype skill. Additionally, when gaining any Magical skill except Resonance, your character gains the Awakened
  trait, or the Emergent trait if Resonance was taken as an archetype skill.</p>
