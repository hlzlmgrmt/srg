<p>Healing can remove damage or strain from a character, cure toxins and diseases, or allow to shut deaths door for
  anyone seeing the light. Additionally, healing spells can temporarily relieve the negative effects af allergies and
  addictions. Typically, healing spells are more difficult to cast than similat Medicine skill checks, but are often
  more versatile and quicker in their use. Generally, boosts and setbacks that apply to Medicine skill checks also apply
  for Healing spells.</p>
