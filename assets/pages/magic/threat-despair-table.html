          your bidding because it is bound to do so. Downgrade the ability of all checks your spirit makes. At the
          Gamemasters discretion, an exceptionally unhappy spirit will do their tasks according to the letter, and
          either do the bare minimum of the task, or tries to actively get its master into trouble.</span>

        <span><b>Stunted Magic: </b>Until the end of the encounter or scene, count your Essence Loss as one higher than
          it actually is. If this would cause you to burn out, you instead take a Critical Injury and are unable to use
          magic until the end of the encounter or scene.</span><br/>
        <span><b>Angered Spirit: </b>Your spirit is exceptionally angry that you have conjured it, let alone that you
          dare to command it like some lowly servant. You suffer a Critical Injury, and then must immediately succeed a
          contested Disciple vs. Discipline check against the spirit in order to remain in control of is actions, after
          which this effect is treated like the <i>Displeased Spirit</i> effect. If you fail, your conjured spirit
          immediately becomes hostile, and is added as a new separate adversary that only targets the conjurer. If the
          spirit is destroyed or banished, the conjurer permanently upgrades all checks attempting to summon that type
          of spirit again until they have made amends with it. (At the Gamemasters discretion)</span>
