<p>Magical skills are a unique subset of skills that only the Awakened and Emergent can utilize. There exist five
  different magical skills: Spellcasting, Summoning, Qi-Magic, Mysticism and Resonance. Even among magical skills,
  Resonance is unique, because ranks in it can only be taken by characters with the Emergent trait (which is mutually
  exclusive to the Awakened trait), while the other four can only be learned by characters with the Awakened trait.
  Regardless, even though Technomancy as a whole and the use of Resonance specifically is not magic, as a skill it still
  adheres to the same basic rules as the other magical skills, so it is considered one for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>Using a magical skill or taking a rank in one requires a character to have it as an archetype skill, which can be
  taken at character creation or later as a talent.</p>

<h3>Using Magical Skills</h3>
<p>[â€¦]. Usually, magic is bad at interacting with highly sophisticated technology, as cameras need extra work to be
  fooled by illusions, and mind-altering magic fails to be of any use if transmitted through a wire.</p>

<h4>Magic and Essence</h4>
<p>Since magical skills are tied to life, and especially the holistic integrity of the metahuman body and soul
  manipulating it, any loss in Essence directly influences the Dice Pool when taking Magical skill checks. For every
  point of essence lost, the difficulty of the skill check is upgraded once, increasing the chance that something goes
  horribly wrong while casting a spell or weaving the Matrix.</p>

<h4>Burning Out</h4>
<p>When the loss of essence is greater then the Willpower characteristic of the magician or technomancer, their mystical
  grip on the Manasphere or the Resonance fade, and they burn out. A burned-out magician can (usually) never recover
  from this, and loses all of their magical archetype skills. Due to this, a burn-out cannot use their magical skills or
  take any more ranks in any magical skill, even tough (at the GMs discretion) they can either utilize their magical
  skills as new Knowledge skills (with Intellect as the new characteristic), or gain a discount and potential archetype
  skill on a related skills (such as Hacking for technomancers).</p>
