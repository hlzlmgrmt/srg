<p>The <i>Shadowrun Genesys</i> project is a one-to six man project that aims to reduce the crunch of the Shadowrun
  TTRPGs and minimize them into a simpler, yet similarily exciting format. Ports of Shadowrun for the <i>Genesys</i> and
  <i>GURPS</i> systems already exist, but they often keep the bloated complexity of the original system, resulting in
  hundreds of pages of tables and sub-rules of sub-rules that make switching to those ports difficult.</p>
