<p>Not all goods are available on the open market; The jurisdictions of nations and corporations have a keen interest of
  keeping exceptionally effective tools to themselves. In the hands of unauthorized personnel or civilians, the
  purchase, use and carry of these items is considered illegal, and is being pursued by law enforcement and private
  security alike.</p>
<p>What is and isnâ€™t restricted depends heavily on the jurisdiction a character might find herself in, and therefore is
  subject to the Gamemasters discretion. Buying or selling illegal items on the Black Market typically requires a
  Streetwise check. The difficulty of the check depends on the rarity of the item and may increased or decreased,
  depending of the state of the local law enforcement capabilities (as determined by the Gamemaster). A
  <span class="glyph">hhh</span> or <span class="glyph">d</span> on the check could mean that something has gone
  terribly wrong; the seller tries to rob her customers, or the runners find themselves surrounded by undercover cops.
