<p>Some equipment features special qualities that add variety and depth to the massive array of weapons, armor, and
  items that exist in the Sixth World. Some qualities are inherent so certain items, in order to differentiate them from
  another outside of simple damage numbers, while others can be applied through modifications to specifically tailor a
  piece of equipment to someones liking.</p>
<p>Item qualities are generally either passive or active. Passive qualities are always "on" and require no activation on
  the part of the user. Active qualities must be triggered by the user, often by spending one or more
  <span class="glyph">a</span> to activate the effect.</p>
<p>Item qualities often have a number associated with them. This is their <b>rating</b>. Ratings affect qualities in
  different ways, depending on the quality in question.</p>
<p>Active qualities require <span class="glyph">aa</span> to activate unless otherwise stated in their description.</p>


<h3>Accurate (Passive)</h3>
<p>Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology, and have an inherit advantage as a
  consequence of that. For each rank of this quality, the attacker adds <span class="glyph boost">j</span> to their
  combat checks while using this weapon.</p>

<h3>Blast (Active)</h3>
<p>The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or a similar area of effect, like a detonated grenade or a warhead
  fired from a missile launcher. If the attack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or foe) engaged
  with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the Blast quality’s rating, plus damage equal to the
  total <span class="glyph">s</span> scored on the check.</p>
<p>In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Game Master might decide that everyone in the room suffers damage.</p>
<p>If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the
  firer (or quick reactions on the part of the targets) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius.
  However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses by spending <span class="glyph">aaa</span>. In this
  case, the original target and every target engaged with the original target suffers a hit dealing damage equal to the
  Blast rating of the weapon.</p>

<h3>Breach (Passive)</h3>
<p>Weapons with Breach burn through the toughest armor; they are often heavy weapons or weapons mounted on some sort of
  vehicle.</p>
<p>Hits from weapons with the Breach quality ignore one point of vehicle armor for every rating of Breach (meaning they
  also ignore 10 soak for every rating of Breach).</p>

<h3>Burn (Active)</h3>
<p>Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. When Burn is triggered, one target hit by the attack continues to suffer
  the weapon’s base damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating. Apply damage at the
  start of each of the target’s turns. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Burn, the quality may be
  triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.</p>
<p>A victim might be able to stop the damage by performing an action to roll around and make a Coordination check. The
  difficulty is Average (<span class="glyph difficulty">kk</span>) on hard surfaces such as the floor of a building, or
  Easy (<span class="glyph difficulty">k</span>) on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage
  immediately. Both situations assume the flame is from actual combustion rather than a chemical reaction. With the
  latter, there is usually little the victim can do.</p>

<h3>Concealed (Passive)</h3>
<p>Equipment with Concealed are harder to spot and to find, by having a combination of a particular small profile,
  scanner-resistant materials or an unusual form. For each rank of this quality, anyone attempting to find the item,
  including through scanners and the Matrix, adds <span class="glyph setback">j</span> to checks to find the item.</p>

<h3>Concussive (Active)</h3>
<p>The weapon’s attack can leave the target shell-shocked from mighty blows or punishing shock waves, unable to perform
  any but the most basic actions. When Concussive is triggered, one target hit by the attack is staggered for a number
  of rounds equal to the weapon’s Concussive rating. A staggered target cannot perform actions. If multiple targets
  suffer hits from a weapon with Concussive, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target
  each time.</p>

<h3>Cumbersome (Passive)</h3>
<p>A Cumbersome weapon is large, unwieldy, awkward, or heavy. To wield a Cumbersome weapon properly, the character needs
  a Brawn characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon’s Cumbersome rating. For each point of Brawn by which the
  character is deficient, they must increase the difficulty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.</p>

<h3>Defensive (Passive)</h3>
<p>An item with the Defensive quality increases the user’s melee defense by its Defensive rating.</p>

<h3>Deflective (Passive)</h3>
<p>An item with the Deflective quality increases the user’s ranged defense by its Deflective rating.</p>

<h3>Disorient (Active)</h3>
<p>A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When Disorient is triggered, one target hit by the attack is
  disoriented for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Disorient rating. A disoriented target adds
  <span class="glyph setback">j</span> to all skill checks they perform. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon
  with Disorient, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.</p>

<h3>Ensnare (Active)</h3>
<p>A weapon with Ensnare binds a foe and restricts their movements. When Ensnare is triggered, one target hit by the
  attack becomes immobilized. for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ensnare rating. An immobilized target cannot
  perform maneuvers. If multiple targets suffer hits from a weapon with Ensnare, the quality may be triggered multiple
  times, affecting a different target each time.</p>

<h3>Full-Auto (Active)</h3>
<p>A weapon with Full-Auto can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with bolts, flechettes,
  slugs, or other types of projectiles. The advantage in using Full-Auto is that it has the chance to hit multiple
  targets or to hit a single target multiple times.</p>
<p>As attacking with a weapon in Full-Auto is generally less accurate, the attacker must increase the difficulty of the
  combat check by <span class="glyph difficulty">k</span>. The user may choose not to use the Full-Auto quality on a
  weapon; in this case, they cannot trigger the quality but also do not suffer the aforementioned penalty.</p>
<p>If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Full-Auto by spending <span class="glyph">aa</span>. Full-Auto can be
  triggered multiple times. Each time the attacker triggers Full-Auto it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of
  these counts as an additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus the number of
  <span class="glyph">s</span> on the check.</p>
<p>These additional hits can be allocated to the original target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the
  attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, they must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if they wish
  to hit multiple targets, their initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest
  defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses which is the initial target). The initial hit must always be
  against the initial target. Subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets.</p>
<p>Full-Auto weapons can also activate one Critical Injury for each hit generated on the attack, per the normal rules;
  the Critical Injury must be applied to the target of the specific hit.</p>

<h3>Guided (Active)</h3>
<p>A weapon with the Guided quality can track opponents. The Guided quality can only be triggered if an attack misses.
  If Guided is triggered, the controlling character may make a combat check at the end of the round as an out-of-turn
  incidental. The difficulty of this combat check is Average (<span class="glyph difficulty">kk</span>); instead of
  building the ability of the pool normally, add <span class="glyph ability">k</span> equal to the weapon’s Guided
  rating. If the check is successful, the weapon strikes the target, and the attack is resolved normally.</p>
<p>Guided requires <span class="glyph">aaa</span> to activate, unless otherwise specified in the weapon’s description.
  The Guided quality can activate on any subsequent combat check it makes, representing the projectile continuing to
  track the target.</p>

<h3>Hardened (Passive)</h3>
<p>Weapons or items with the Hardened quality are immune to the Sunder quality. Armor with the Hardened quality make
  the wearer’s soak immune to the Pierce and Breach qualities.</p>

<h3>Inaccurate (Passive)</h3>
<p>Inaccurate weapons are less likely to be accurate or precise. When making an attack with an Inaccurate weapon,
  add <span class="glyph setback">j</span> to the check equal to the Inaccurate rating.</p>

<h3>Inferior (Passive)</h3>
<p>An Inferior item is a lackluster example of its kind, representing shoddy and poor craftsmanship. An Inferior item
  generates automatic <span class="glyph">h</span> on all checks related to its use.</p>

<h3>Knockdown (Active)</h3>
<p>When Knockdown is triggered, one target hit by the attack is knocked prone. If multiple targets suffer hits from a
  weapon with Knockdown, the quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time.</p>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, Knockdown requires <span class="glyph">aa</span> to trigger, plus one additional
  <span class="glyph">a</span> per silhouette of the target beyond 1.</p>

<h3>Limited Ammo (Passive)</h3>
<p>Some weapons fire particularly large or complex projectiles that cost lots of money. Other weapons are expendable
  weapons like grenades that, once used, are destroyed. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality may be used to make a
  number of attacks equal to its Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a maneuver. In addition, each shot
  expends one of a limited number of rounds of ammo; more ammo must be purchased or obtained before anyone fires the
  weapon again. This also applies to grenades and other “one-use” weapons that have the Limited Ammo 1 quality (here,
  your character is not “reloading” the grenade, but drawing another to use—mechanically, they are equivalent).</p>

<h3>Linked (Active)</h3>
<p>Some weapons are designed to fire together at the same target (turrets housing multiple guns are a good example of
  this). When a character fires a linked weapon, on a successful attack, the weapon deals one hit. The wielder may spend
  <span class="glyph">aa</span> to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number of times equal to the weapon’s Linked
  rating. Additional hits from the Linked weapon may only be applied against the original target. Each hit deals the
  weapon’s base damage plus damage equal to the <span class="glyph">s</span> scored on the check.</p>

<h3>Nonlethal (Passive)</h3>
<p>A weapon with this quality can only deal strain damage (damage applied to the target’s strain threshold). Because
  this is strain <i>damage</i>, not strain, it is still reduced by a target’s soak.</p>

<h3>Pierce (Passive)</h3>
<p>Any hits from this weapon ignore a number of points point of soak equal to the weapon’s Pierce rating. If the weapon
  has more ranks of Pierce than the target’s total soak, it completely ignores the target’s soak. For example, Pierce 3
  against a soak of 2 ignores two points of soak, but the extra point of Pierce has no further effect.</p>

<h3>Prepare (Passive)</h3>
<p>Items with this quality require time to set up before being used. The user must perform a number of preparation
  maneuvers equal to the item’s Prepare rating before using the item (if the item is a weapon, “using” it would be
  making attacks with the weapon). At your GM’s discretion, moving with the item, being knocked prone with the item, or
  other disruptions may require the user to perform the preparation maneuvers again before using the item.</p>

<h3>Slow-Firing (Passive)</h3>
<p>Slow-Firing weapons tend to deal incredible damage, but need time to recharge or cool down between shots. A weapon’s
  Slow-Firing rating dictates the number of rounds that must pass before the weapon can be fired again after attacking.
  For example, a gauss rifle with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two rounds after being fired before it can be fired again.</p>

<h3>Stun (Active)</h3>
<p>A weapon with Stun can deal strain to the target. When the Stun quality is activated, it inflicts strain equal to the
  weapon’s Stun rating. Since this is strain, and not strain <i>damage</i>, it is not reduced by the target’s soak.</p>

<h3>Sunder (Active)</h3>
<p>When activating Sunder, the attacker chooses one item openly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or item
  on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to minor if undamaged, from minor to moderate, or from moderate to major.
  If an item already suffering major damage is the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed.</p>
<p>Sunder requires <span class="glyph">a</span> to activate, and may be activated even if the attack is unsuccessful.
  Sunder may be activated multiple times in the same attack, but each activation must be applied to the same item,
  potentially taking it from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack.</p>

<h3>Superior (Passive)</h3>
<p>A Superior item is a sterling example of its kind, representing masterful craftsmanship. A Superior item generates
  automatic <span class="glyph">a</span> on all checks related to its use. A Superior weapon has its base damage
  increased by one, while a Superior armor hase its encumbrance reduced by one and its soak value increased by one.</p>

<h3>Throwable (Passive)</h3>
<p>A melee weapon with the Throwable quality can be thrown at targets. Its range increases to Short range, and it gains
  the Limited Ammo 1 quality. Unless otherwise specified, weapons with the Throwable trait are thrown with the Ranged
  skill; lighter weapons, such as Knives use the Ranged (Light) skill, while bigger weapons, such as javelins, use the
  Ranged (Heavy) skill.</p>

<h3>Unwieldy (Passive)</h3>
<p>An Unwieldy weapon is a weapon that can be particularly awkward to use for those without impressive dexterity and
  hand-eye coordination. To wield an Unwieldy weapon properly, the character needs an Reflexes characteristic equal to
  or greater than the weapon’s Unwieldy rating. For each point of Reflexes by which the character is deficient, they
  must increase the difficulty of all checks made while using the weapon by one.</p>

<h3>Vicious (Passive)</h3>
<p>When an attack with this weapon results in a Critical Injury or Hit, the character adds ten times the Vicious rating
  to the Critical roll. With Vicious 3, for example, you would add +30 to the resulting Critical Injury or Hit
  result.</p>
