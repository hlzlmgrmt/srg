<h5>Katana</h5>
<p>This isn’t your great-grandfathers traditionally made sword, chummer, but this doesn’t stop this weapon from being an
  extremely deadly tool in the right hands. Mostly popularized by trideos, the katana have become a cliched staple for
  the street samurai and shadowrunners in general. Everyone – including deckers and mages – carries one of these, which
  is why there are probably more katanas on the market than of any other weapon.</p>
<p>Katanas are rather heavy, and therefore wielded with both hands.</p>
