<p>Brawling weapons are used to improve on hand-to-hand combat. They are usually used with the Brawl skill against a
  target within Engaged (<span class="glyph difficulty">kk</span>) range. Unless otherwise noted (or at the Gamemasters
  discretion), the hands of someone wielding a Brawl weapon stays free, enabling them to interact with objects.</p>
