<p>One-handed ranged weapons, such as tasers, pistols and mini-crossbows are light weapons, either primarily used as
  sidearms for non-combat heavy scenarios or utilized for more inconspicuous work. Characters using one-handed ranged
  weapons use the Ranged (Light) skill.</p>

<h5>Light Pistol</h5>
<p>Commonly seen in the pockets of city-dwellers, light pistols cover about any civilian-issued handgun.</p>
<p>
  <span><b>Models Include:</b> <i>Ares Light Fire 70, Beretta 21IT, Colt America L26, Fichetti Executive Action</i></span>
</p>

<h5>Heavy Pistol</h5>
<p>The bigger, meaner brother of the pistol family. The heavy pistol utilizes bigger cartridges than its’ civilian
  counterparts (or even most SMGs, for that matter) and therefore packs a bigger punch than most other handguns.
  Shadowrunners, Corporate Agents and Drugged-Up Gang-Bangers alike favor these weapons as their main weapons in close
  quarters. Unlike their lighter counterparts, heavy pistols often require licenses and are not always completely legal
  to buy and carry.</p>
<p><span><b>Models Include: </b><i>Colt Government 2066, Browning Ultra-Power, Ares Predator V</i></span></p>

<h5>Holdout Pistol</h5>
<p>Hold-out pistols are very cheap and concealable, making them perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up
  piece. Street-scum often carry these as a self-defense weapon. They don’t have much else going for them.</p>
<p><span><b>Models Include: </b><i>Streetline Special, Fianchetti Tiffany Self-Defender 2075</i></span></p>

<h5>Taser</h5>
<p>This pacifists' weapon of choice fires small needles, that deliver a large electric shock through the attached wires
  into the unfortunate victim. Security forces, civilians and runners alike tend to carry these in order to non-lethally
  incapacitate their targets. Generally speaking, tasers are completely legal in almost all jurisdictions and
  surprisingly effective against armored targets, but require the re-cocking of the weapon after every shot. Don’t
  expect gangers to carry these.</p>
<p><span><b>Models Include: </b><i>Defiance EX-Shocker, Yamaha Pulsar, Tiffany-Defiance Protector</i></span></p>

<h5>Mini-Crossbow</h5>
<p>Originally developed as a weapon for silent assassinations, various models of dart-shooters and pistol crossbows have
  hit the market after the widespread success of the Sliver. Surprisingly, due to the simple construction of a crossbow,
  the mini-crossbow sees widespread use as a lightweight sidearm among scuba divers and subnautical combat divers.</p>
<p>Mini-Crossbows are silent, adding <span class="glyph setback">jjj</span> to all Perception and Vigilance checks made
  to locate a concealed shooter. Mini-Crossbows also do not suffer penalties from being fired underwater, in zero-air-
  or zero-gravity environments. Mini-Crossbows must be reloaded after every shot, and can load a wide variety of
  arrowheads.</p>
<p><span><b>Models Include: </b><i>Ares Silverlight II, Ranger Sliver Pistol Crossbow </i></span></p>

<h5>Dart Pistol</h5>
<p>Parashield and Narcoject have released a series of weapons that defined the industry strandard for non-lethal dart
  pistols. Usually carried as a specialized sidearm of special forces teams in hostage situations, dart pistols shoot
  injection darts that deliver their payload on successful impact. Usually, that payload consists of a strong narcotic
  agent, but these darts can be filled with all kinds of toxins and drugs, if one so desires.</p>
<p>Dart pistols can never deal more than one wound, and do never case any Critical Injuries by themselves; instead, when
  a successful ranged combat check with the dart pistol delivers a wound to the target, the dart administers its’
  payload. The target then makes a Resilience check with a difficulty equal to the severity of the administered
  narcotic. By default, the darts inject narcoject or a similar nerve agent (see “Narcoject” (p. [Page]), but when a
  character is using a custom payload (see “Drugs and Toxins” (p. [Page]), use the table “Effects, Severity & Scarcity”
  (p. [Page]) to determine the relevant statistics for the specific narcotic.</p>
